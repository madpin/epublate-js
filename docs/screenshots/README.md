# Screenshots

The `README.md` and `docs/USAGE.md` reference screenshots living in this folder. Each one captures a specific app state on a specific screen at a specific viewport.

The shipped images are real PNGs captured against a dev server running in `?mock=1` mode, so the LLM responses are deterministic and the cost meter renders predictable numbers. The capture is fully automated by **`tools/snap.mjs`** at the repo root.

## Refresh the screenshots

```bash
npm run dev                            # one terminal: serves http://localhost:5173
node tools/snap.mjs                    # another terminal: walks every screen
```

The script:

1. Resets every IndexedDB DB the SPA owns (clean slate every run).
2. Creates a project from `tests/fixtures/petitprince.epub` via the New Project modal, with `auto_intake = true` and `tone_sniff = false` for deterministic helper-LLM behaviour.
3. Walks the project-level screens by SPA navigation (preserving Dexie context across hops):
   - Projects empty → New Project modal → Dashboard → Translate batch → Dashboard (translated) → Reader (Chapitre III, prose-rich) → Glossary → Inbox → Project Settings (default + **Relevant context mode**) → Lore Books → Settings → LLM (default + **Embeddings card** + **Install card**) → Intake runs → LLM activity → Cheat sheet → Theme picker → Projects populated → Hero (Dashboard).
4. Saves PNGs into this folder using the contract filenames listed below.

The capture runs at viewport `1024 × 640` against the default `epublate` theme. To re-capture in a different theme, set `THEME` in the script (`epublate`, `textual-dark`, `textual-light`, `epublate-contrast`).

> Filenames are the doc contract — keep them stable across captures so the docs don't break.

|    | `09e-chapter-summaries.png`           | Project Settings    | **Chapter summaries** card listing chapters with per-row generate / clear actions and the bulk "Generate missing" / "Regenerate all" controls. |

| 12 | `10-lore-books.png`                   | Lore Books          | Empty Lore Books library with the New Lore Book + Import bundle CTAs.                             |

|    | `12c-ollama-options-card.png`         | Settings → Ollama options | Ollama-specific knobs (`num_ctx`, `num_predict`, sampling, Mirostat, **Disable thinking**) revealed via "Show anyway" because the mock base URL is OpenAI. Shows the four common-tier inputs + preset chips. |
|    | `12b-embeddings-card.png`             | Settings → Embeddings| Embeddings card scrolled into view — provider picker (none / openai-compat / local), model, dim, batch size, and consent state. |
|    | `12d-batch-reliability-card.png`      | Settings → Batch reliability | Per-segment retry budget + sliding-window circuit breaker (`Max retries per segment`, `Recent-segment window`, `Failures before pause`) with the Restore-defaults button. |
| 14 | `13-intake-runs.png`                  | Intake runs         | List of helper-LLM intake runs for the seeded project.                                            |

| 18 | `17-install-pwa.png`                  | Settings → Install  | Install card scrolled into view: install-state pill, "App cached for offline use" pill, online/offline pill, and the **Install epublate** button. Headless Chromium doesn't fire `beforeinstallprompt`, so the deterministic state is "Browser-managed install" with the explanatory hint visible. |

The capture script does *not* exercise the per-chapter Translate Chapter modal (`05b`) or the Lore Book dashboard (`11`) yet; both are described in prose in `docs/USAGE.md` until we wire them up.

## Mock mode tips

- The mock provider fills the cache deterministically, so re-running a batch shows realistic cache-rate numbers.
- The seeded project (`tests/fixtures/petitprince.epub`) is one of the public-domain ePubs already exercised by the test suite; swapping in a longer book is fine if you want a meatier hero shot.
- If a screenshot needs a "before" state (empty Inbox, empty Glossary), let `snap.mjs` reset Dexie at the start — every run starts from a wiped library.
